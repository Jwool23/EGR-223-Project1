                            Some of my favorite comics to read are Spiderman, Star Wars, Batman.

                        <p class="card-text mt-3">I have been playing video games since I was a kid. Whether it was a handheld console like the PSP or a home console like the Xbox, I was almost never seen not gaming.
                            Some of my favorites of the years are Destiny, Warframe, Devil May Cry, and Dragon Ball Z Tenkaichi Tag Team.

                        <p class="card-text mt-3">I am a very active person so I gravitated to sports early on. I have played many sports over the years but the ones that stand out the most to me
                            are ultimate frisbee, track and field, and basketball. I've competed in all three and these are the ones that I always come back to.
