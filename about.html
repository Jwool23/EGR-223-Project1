                    I am a software engineering student at Cal Baptist University. I am currently in my senior year and I am looking forward to graduating in the spring of 2023. 
                    I have always had a passion for technology and I am excited to see where my career takes me. I am currently working on a project that will help me get my foot in the door in the tech industry.
                    I am excited to see where my career takes me and I am looking forward to the opportunities that come my way.

                        I have been interested in technology since I started playing video games. I have been facinated with how they are created and what it takes to do it.
                        My dad is an electrical engineer so he was able to introduce me into this world and helped me understand the basics of technology.
                        I started taking coding classes over summers and through high school and I have been facinated with it ever since.
