                                working on a project that will help me get my foot in the door in the tech industry and I am excited to see where my career takes me.

                            <p class="card-text mt-3">After I graduate from CBU, I plan to continue my education in law school. My end goal is to become a patent attorney. I have always been interested in video games
                                but going through the classes I did not want to have that be my end job. I have had in interest in law for a while and after speaking with some attorneys and taking some law classes, I
                                decided to become an attorney for a gaming company or a law firm that works with IPs.
